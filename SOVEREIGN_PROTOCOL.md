## 1. ⚔️ The Revenue Split & Economic Friction

The protocol operates on a fixed **1 SYNL Execution Fee** per successful run. This fee is the primary driver of the ecosystem and is governed by an immutable splitter.

### **The Split (1 SYNL):**

* **50% Founder Vault**: Permanent royalty to the Founding Company for platform architecture.
* **10% Logic Creator**: Paid to the author of the specific Atomic ID used in the run.
* **40% Community Audit Pool (CAP)**: Funds the "Sovereign Immune System" (Forensics, Jury compute, and Sentinel rewards).

> **Rule of Redirection**: If a creator "untangles" their address or fails to maintain an Atomic, their 10% royalty is permanently redirected to the **Community Audit Pool (CAP)**. There are **NO burn addresses**.

## 2. 💎 Token Distribution Strategy (The 1-Year Exit)

**Goal**: Distribute **1 Billion $SYNL** tokens to the community within **365 days** to spark massive initial interest and decentralize ownership.

### **Rules of Reward (Anti-Gaming):**

* **Creator Bounty**: Rewards for minting new Atomics with a Jury-verified BPS > 8500.
* **Usage Rebate**: Users earn $SYNL for running recipes, but the rebate is always **Net-Negative** (the cost to run exceeds the reward) to prevent bot farming.
* **Referral Multiplier**: Referrers earn a % of the $SYNL generated by their recruits, only after the recruit completes a "Genesis Proof" run.
* **Unique Data Hashing**: Every run is hashed. Duplicate data inputs earn **ZERO tokens**.

## 3. ⚖️ The Audit & SDK Authority (CID System)

The "Master" versions of the scripts are managed via **On-Chain Pointers (CIDs)** to allow for permissionless competition and community-driven improvement.

### **Governed Authorities:**

1. **Auditor Logic (Audit Sweep)**:
* **Baseline**: Currently `v3_genesis_sweep.js`.
* **Evolution**: The community can propose a "Better Audit" (e.g., higher forensic density). If a DAO vote passes, the Ledger's `Audit_CID` is updated globally.


2. **Execution Engine (SDK Master)**:
* **Baseline**: Currently `Sovereign_Engine_Master.ps1`.
* **Evolution**: The community can outcompete the master engine with faster or more gas-efficient versions. If the community promotes a new `Engine_CID`, all SDKs switch instantly.

## 4. 🛡️ The Sovereign Immune System (Self-Funding)

There is **NO auditing cost** for the Founder. Forensics are funded by those who use the system.

* **Demand-Based Auditing**: Atomics are only audited if they are being used.
* **The Bounty**: High-usage Atomics trigger a $SYNL "Compute Bounty" that pays for the Grok-based silo audits and 10-person jury.
* **Frequency**: Usage-weighted (Low usage = weekly audit; High usage = daily/hourly).
* **Untangling**: Creators can opt-out of their logic to avoid audit costs; the logic becomes "public property" managed by the CAP.

## 5. 🛠️ Session Reconciler (Today's Key Milestones)

* **Date**: 2025-12-29.
* **Logic Hardening**: Moved from local file dependency to **On-Chain CID Authority**.
* **Revenue Fix**: Locked the **Founder 50%** split regardless of logic upgrades.
* **Security Fix**: Implemented **Unique Data Hashing** to prevent reward-gaming.
* **Governance Fix**: Established the **Community Audit Pool (CAP)** as the fail-safe destination for all orphaned royalties.
