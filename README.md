# Synthesis Ledger Protocol (Genesis V3)

### *The Sovereign Immune System for Agentic Logic*

The Synthesis Ledger is a decentralized protocol designed to solve the "Intelligence Entropy" crisis in AI agents. By moving agentic logic from fragile local text to **Immutable Synapses** on-chain, we enforce logic survival through a blockchain-backed immune system.

## 🏛️ Protocol Anchors
- **Genesis V3 Ledger**: `0x030A8e0eC9f584484088a4cea8D0159F32438613` (Base Mainnet)
- **$SYNL Token**: `0x86FaA99Eb3CBD46BB53807fcd93B8a08D70116E0`
- **Network**: Base (Layer 2)

## 📊 Live Protocol Status (Epoch 01)
- **Genesis Atomics**: 38/38 Secured
- **Survival Floor**: 7800 BPS (78.00% Success Density)
- **Audit Standard**: Horpestad Standard (Grok-4.1 Jury Consensus)
- **Update Cooldown**: 144 Hours (6 Days) officially enforced

## 🛡️ Sovereign Security Model
The Ledger does not merely record logic; it enforces its quality through a multi-tiered adversarial audit:
1. **Four Specialist Silos**: Independent audits for SRE metrics, Security vulnerabilities, Economic game theory, and Structural integrity.
2. **10-Person Jury**: A reasoning-based synthetic jury that synthesizes silo reports into a final deterministic BPS.
3. **Audit Hash Provenance**: Every BPS update on-chain contains a `keccak256` hash of the full jury deliberation, creating an immutable trail of "The Cold Truth."

## ⚙️ Immune System Protections
- **The Strike System**: Logic falling below 7800 BPS during an audit cycle receives a strike.
- **Terminal Obsolescence**: 3 strikes result in permanent deactivation and revenue siphoning.
- **Time-Lock Enforcement**: Scores are immutable during the 6-day cooldown period to prevent logic manipulation.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `/agent`: Autonomous Sentinel workers for real-time monitoring.
- `/contracts`: Flat architecture source files (V3).
- `genesis_onchain.json`: The technical source of truth for all Genesis Atomics.
- `audit_proofs/`: (External) Permanent storage for forensic Jury deliberation logs.
